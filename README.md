# Mayday
Hexapod robot designed from the bottom up to look organic, with smooth curves and move organically by having motorcontrol trained using a neural network, rather than hard coded as a set of movements. Its purpose is to be. To exist and explore its surroundings. Using ARCore on its built in smartphone, it will be able to map and locate in a confined space, such as my apartment.
